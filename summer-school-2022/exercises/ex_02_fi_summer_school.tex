\aufgabe{Application}{
%Make yourself familiar with the iml package in R and the method FeatureEffects.
Answer the following questions for your chosen dataset
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make yourself familiar with the FeatureImp method in the iml package and calculate the permutation feature importance (PFI) for all features in your dataset. Calculate the PFI on your training and on your test dataset. Do you observe any differences? Interpret your results.
\item Write a function which calculates the LOCO feauture importance on the test dataset. How does it differ to the PFI results? Explain your observation.\\
Hint: Refit your model on the training data without the feature of interest. Predict with the refitted model on the test dataset and calculate the loss difference between your original model and your refitted model. Repeat for all features.
\item Compare your feature importance values to your feature effect results of the first exercise sheet. Are they conclusive?
\end{enumerate}
